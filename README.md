# 🤖 Agent Reasoning Evaluator

### 🧠 Overview
**Agent Reasoning Evaluator** is a lightweight web app built with **Streamlit** that analyzes and annotates reasoning trajectories of AI agents.  
It simulates how intelligent agents reason, make decisions, and sometimes make logical or factual errors — allowing users to evaluate and visualize their performance.

The project was inspired by **agentic AI concepts** and practical insights from workshops on **NVIDIA NeMo Toolkit** and **AgentToolkit**.
